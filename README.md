Module: User Authentication (Registration & Login)
Test Case Title: Test Case for Registration and Login Functionality
Description:
This test case validates the core user authentication features of the Fabric lagbe web platform. It covers the complete flow of user registration (sign-up) and user login, ensuring users can securely create accounts, log in with valid credentials, and handle invalid or missing inputs gracefully.

Test Objectives:

Ensure the registration form accepts valid input and stores user data correctly.

Validate that the login form authenticates users with correct credentials.

Verify error messages are shown for invalid inputs (e.g., empty fields, wrong password).

Check field validations (e.g., email format, password length).

Confirm that after login, users are redirected to the appropriate dashboard or homepage.
